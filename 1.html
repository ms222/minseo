    <h2>PUDDLE-초귀욤둥이</H2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" target="_blank" title="wikipedia">The domestic dog</a>(Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf or
      Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species)[5] is a member of the genus
      Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids,[6] and is the most
      widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.[7][8][9][10][11] The dog and the extant
      gray wolf are sister taxa[12][13][14] as modern wolves are not closely related to
      the wolves that were first domesticated,[13][14] which implies that the direct
      ancestor of the dog is extinct.[15] The dog was the first species to be domesticated[14
      [16] and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory
      capabilities, and physical attributes.[17]</p>
